Reflect the udp packets on a source port to a mirrored destination port.  Data is captured at the data link layer using libpcap.  This allows another process to bind to the port, and avoids the error "Bind: Address Already in Use".  udp\_reflector supports both multiple packet destinations and multiple ignore ports which are used to prevent the infinite looping of packets between multiple udp\_reflectors.
